Catharsis comes as a web application that puts at the users' disposal tickets for theater shows taking place around them. 


## Description

By accessing the web site, the user is able to see a list of all the theater events from the city selected and a written and visual description of them, along with the possibility to select the available seat/s in the theatersâ€™ auditorium. 

Each event comes with a separate page where the users are invited to save their preference, rate and comment their opinions over the specific show. 

Users could use the application with and without having an account, but for purchases there will be necessary to provide some personal details. There will also be the possibility for them to sign in with their g-mail accounts. 

The methods of payment are specified at the top of the page, in two different currencies and a calendar will be displayed in order to facilitate a date search along with the classic ones: by name and by location.
